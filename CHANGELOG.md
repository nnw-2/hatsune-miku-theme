## [1.1.6] - 2025-09-30

### Changes

* Initial release of the Hatsune Miku theme
* Making the extension actually be connected to github repository.
* Making linked images hopefully be displayed
* Making the theme be installable on earlier vs code versions (1.90.0 now the earliest compatable version)
* Adding miku and dark tags/keywords for vs code marketplace
* Added the theme editor allowing the user to change colour and transparency of things within the editor.
* Hopefully fixed unwanted behaviour from theme editor which wasn't present when testing - user needing to reload window manually to see changes.
* Added a better interface for the editor customiser to account for the many new buttons which will need to be added.
* 2 new functional buttons added. After changing the colour or transparency of something it no longer brings you back to the first view, it will instead stay on the view where you clicked the button to change something. More convenient.
* 2 new buttons added. Change matching bracket background + border.
* 2 new buttons added. Change Find Match background and border.

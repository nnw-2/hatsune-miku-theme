## [1.1.3] - 2025-08-13

### Changes

* Initial release of the Hatsune Miku theme
* Making the extension actually be connected to github repository.
* Making linked images hopefully be displayed
* Making the theme be installable on earlier vs code versions (1.90.0 now the earliest compatable version)
* Adding miku and dark tags/keywords for vs code marketplace
* Added the theme editor allowing the user to change colour and transparency of things within the editor.
* Hopefully fixed unwanted behaviour from theme editor which wasn't present when testing - user needing to reload window manually to see changes.
* Added a better interface for the editor customiser to account for the many new buttons which will need to be added.

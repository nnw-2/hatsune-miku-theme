## How to use the editor customiser (only changes the editor for this theme):
Each button either changes the colour or transparency of something within the editor.
Open a new file, make some changes and see what you like most. Above the buttons will
be a description of what gets changed.
When making changes the editor is permanently changed to the new value, there isn't a limit
to the number of times you can make changes.
When clicking a button you are given the ability to cancel or follow the instructions and confirm
a change.
